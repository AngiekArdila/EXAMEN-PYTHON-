# Blockbuster 

Blockbuster is an application designed to manage a comprehensive media database. I made it with functionalities that allow creating, listing, and managing genres, actors, movie formats, and generating reports. The application utilizes JSON files for data storage and supports operations such as adding new entries, listing existing items, and navigating through menus to perform specific tasks.

## Features
- **Genre Management**: Create and list genres.
- **Actor Management**: Create and list actors.
- **Format Management**: Create and list formats.
- **Report Generation**: Generate reports based on stored data.
- **Movie Management**: Perform CRUD operations on movies.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language for logic and functionality.
- **JSON**: Utilized for storing and managing data in structured files.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Used to provide an interactive user experience for managing media data in an effective way.
